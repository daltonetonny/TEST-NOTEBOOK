# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

This Jupyter Notebook analyzes global COVID-19 trends using data from Johns Hopkins University (JHU) CSSE for cases, deaths, and recoveries, and Our World in Data (OWID) for vaccinations. It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, visualizations, and narrative insights.

## Objectives
- Import and clean COVID-19 global data.
- Analyze time trends (cases, deaths, vaccinations).
- Compare metrics across countries.
- Visualize trends with charts and maps.
- Communicate findings in a report.

## Outputs
- Visualizations: PNG charts and HTML choropleth map in `visualizations/`.
- Insights: `docs/covid_insights.md`.
- Dataset: `data/covid_combined_data.csv`.

## 1. Data Collection
Load datasets from JHU CSSE (cases, deaths, recoveries) and OWID (vaccinations).

## 2. Data Exploration
Inspect dataset structure and missing values.

## 3. Data Cleaning
- Reshape JHU datasets to long format.
- Merge datasets.
- Handle missing values.
- Allow user input for country selection (stretch goal).

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis
Analyze trends with visualizations and statistics.

## 5. Vaccination Progress
Visualize vaccination trends.

## 6. Choropleth Map
Visualize global case distribution.

## 7. Insights & Reporting
Summarize findings in a markdown file.
